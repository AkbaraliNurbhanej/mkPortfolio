                            <p>I am a 21-year-old Flutter development enthusiast passionate about learning and building beautiful, responsive cross-platform mobile applications. My journey in development began with mastering the basics of app design and functionality, eventually advancing to Dart and Flutter. Along the way, I’ve enjoyed experimenting with UI layouts, animations, and interactive features to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. <br>

                                My learning experience has been hands-on, involving small projects, solving real-world app development challenges, and exploring best practices in Flutter development. I’m always curious to learn new techniques, optimize app performance, and enhance my coding skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring mobile design trends, debugging complex issues, and sharing my knowledge with others in the tech community.</p>

                                    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building platform-independent applications. It was developed by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is renowned for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

                                    Key Features of Java:
                                    Object-Oriented: It organizes software as a collection of objects that combine data (fields) and methods (functions).
                                    Platform-Independent: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware and OS.
                                    Robust and Secure: Java includes strong memory management and runtime error checking, making it reliable. It also has built-in security features.
                                    Multithreaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
                                    Automatic Memory Management: Java uses garbage collection to handle memory deallocation, reducing memory leaks.
                                    Common Uses of Java:
                                    Web Development: Used with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
                                    Mobile Applications: Especially Android apps (via Kotlin or Java).
                                    Enterprise Applications: Popular in building large-scale, distributed systems.
                                    Game Development: Used for cross-platform games.
                                    Big Data and Analytics: Java tools like Apache Hadoop.
                                    Embedded Systems: For IoT devices and more.</p>

                                    <p>Dart is a client-optimized, object-oriented programming language developed by Google, designed for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. It supports features like asynchronous programming, a rich standard library, and strong typing, making it ideal for modern app development. Dart is the foundation of Flutter, enabling seamless cross-platform UI creation.</p>
