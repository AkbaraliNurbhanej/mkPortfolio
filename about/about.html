                            <p> Bachelor of Computer Applications student</p>
                            <p>I am a 21-year-old Flutter development enthusiast passionate about learning and building beautiful, responsive cross-platform mobile applications. My journey in development began with mastering the basics of app design and functionality, eventually advancing to Dart and Flutter. Along the way, I’ve enjoyed experimenting with UI layouts, animations, and interactive features to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. <br>

                                My learning experience has been hands-on, involving small projects, solving real-world app development challenges, and exploring best practices in Flutter development. I’m always curious to learn new techniques, optimize app performance, and enhance my coding skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring mobile design trends, debugging complex issues, and sharing my knowledge with others in the tech community.</p>

                                        <p>Within my journey of learning Flutter development, I have been involved in a variety of projects and tasks, including:<br>  

                                            • Built cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, focusing on seamless user interfaces and smooth functionality.<br>  
                                            • Integrated Dart code to add interactivity, such as navigation, state management, and form validations.<br>  
                                            • Worked extensively with Flutter widgets to create responsive and dynamic UIs that adapt to different screen sizes.<br>  
                                            • Explored debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues related to layout, performance, and functionality.<br>  
                                            • Created personal projects like task management apps, portfolios, and e-commerce prototypes to practice and showcase my skills.<br>  
                                            • Researched and applied modern Flutter development best practices, including efficient state management, clean architecture, and code optimization.<br>  
                                            • Continuously learned and experimented with new plugins, packages, and tools to improve my app development process and expand my skill set.</p>
